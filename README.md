# tflite-tpu-experiences
## Overview
With the objective of recreating diverse scenarios using tflite together coral devices. This project proposes some labs to experiment with the following use cases.


* Traditional TF & Keras model, conversion to tflite and execution in CoralDevBoard: Academic iris model represented in TF & Keras. Conversion to tflite format (open discussion to compatibility). Executing inferences directly on coral devices?
    * [iris_case](https://github.com/nbortolotti/tflite-tpu-experiences/blob/master/iris_case/README.md) section.    
    
* With the objective to experiment with inferences across models and compare the performance of the inferences between traditional inferences with CPU and inferences using TPU and Coral devices.
    * [inference exploration](https://github.com/nbortolotti/tflite-tpu-experiences/blob/master/inference_exploration/README.md) section
