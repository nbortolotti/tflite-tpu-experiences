# tflite-tpu-experiences
## Overview
With the objective of recreating diverse scenarios using tflite together coral devices. This project proposes some labs to experiment with the following use cases.



*   Traditional TF & Keras model, conversion to tflite and execution in CoralDevBoard: Academic iris model represented in TF & Keras. Conversion to tflite format (open discussion to compatibility). Executing inferences directly on coral devices?
    * [iris_case](https://github.com/nbortolotti/tflite-tpu-experiences/tree/master/iris_case) section.
